# My First Website
Welcome to the repository of my first website! This project marks the beginning of my journey into web development. Although it now stands as an outdated relic of my early coding days, it holds a special place in my heart as the foundation upon which I built my skills.

# About
This site was created using basic HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript. It showcases my initial efforts to understand the web, experiment with design, and bring my ideas to life on the screen. While it may not reflect my current capabilities, it serves as a testament to my growth and learning over the years.
